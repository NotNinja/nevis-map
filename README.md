## Install

Install using the package manager for your desired environment(s):

``` bash
$ npm install --save nevis nevis-map
# OR:
$ bower install --save nevis nevis-map
```

As you can see above, NevisMap does have a peer dependency on [Nevis](https://github.com/Skelp/nevis) so you need to
make sure that you install `nevis` as well.

You'll need to have at least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). While equals should be compatible with all versions of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org), it is only tested against version 4 and above.
